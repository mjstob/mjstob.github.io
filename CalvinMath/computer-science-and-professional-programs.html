<p>There is no question that 1980 is a logical marker for a turn in direction of the department towards computer science. Larry Nyhoff and Sandy Leestma had been teaching computer programming courses for a decade. Three (half-)courses – Computer Programming for Business, for Social Sciences, and for Sciences – were popular enough that people outside the department had to be dragooned into teaching a section or so. Mike Stob taught a section as a senior undergraduate. Then, in 1980, the department launched a computer scene major. The major was heavily mathematics-based. The five required courses included three semesters of calculus, a half credit course in Fortran programming, and a computer science course in Discrete Mathematical Structures. Six elective courses were required but there were only three computer science courses available for those electives – Computer Organization, Data Structures, and Compiler Design. There were enough mathematics and physics electives included so that a student could in principle receive a computer science degree with just 1.5 computer science courses, one of which (discrete math) was really just another mathematics course! As there was so much mathematics required in the computer science major, most computer science majors were double majors.</p>
<p>Just as new faculty and a major curricular revision propelled the mathematics department into a new era in 1961, new hires and a major curricular revision in 1982 launched the computer science program.</p>
<div id="the-1982-computer-science-revision" class="section level2" number="4.1">
<h2>
<span class="header-section-number">4.1</span> The 1982 Computer Science Revision<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#the-1982-computer-science-revision"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>In 1982-83, enough computer science courses were introduced so that a full major in computer science could be offered without the need to count several mathematics courses in the major. Importantly, a two-course sequence in programming was introduced so that the major finally had a robust starting sequence. Initially, the computer language used was Pascal but this would change over the years to Modula 2, C++, and Java. Also, a unique course (at the time) called Perspectives in Computing, was introduced. This senior-level, seminar course placed special emphasis on social implications and ethical and legal issues in computing. While “capstone” courses such as this one are common now due to changing core requirements, they were still somewhat of a novelty when this one was introduced. By 1987–88 there were enough computer science courses so that students had significant choices among electives and could choose one of four emphases in their program. Several courses were of a more applied nature.</p>
<p>In 1995, the department thoroughly revised the major. New courses were introduced and some deleted. The areas of emphases were reduced from five to two (computing and software engineering). A “practical experience” requirement was introduced. The general result of these changes was to make a somewhat more ``applied’’ major while still emphasizing general principles rather than specific technical skills and still being appropriate for graduate-school bound students as well as students immediately entering the
workplace.</p>
<p>In 1996, the department’s proposal to split into two departments summarized the previous fifteen years of curricular development this way:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In summary, the computer science major of fifteen years ago was very theoretical in nature, relied heavily on mathematics, prepared students appropriately for graduate school, and was taught by mathematicians. It has evolved into a major that has a wide array of options including both theoretical and applied courses, is not necessarily dependent on mathematics, prepares students for a variety of careers as well as graduate school, and is most appropriately taught by faculty with specific, recent training and/or experience in computer science.</p>

<span class="header-section-number">4.2</span> Faculty Hiring in the 1980s and 1990s<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#faculty-hiring-in-the-1980s-and-1990s"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>At the start of the 1980-81 academic year, there were 9 tenure-track faculty members and four faculty members who were on one- or two-year term appointments. Just three of those were prepared to teach computer science. Larry Nyhoff and Sandy Leestma, though mathematicians by training, had spent the decade of the 1970s teaching programming and the college was also paying for them to pursue masters degrees in computer science. Dawn Wolthuis had a masters in computer science and was hired on a two-year term position. Dawn would later go on to direct the computer center (as Calvin Information Technology was then called).</p>
<p>As the computer science offerings grew, it was imperative to find computer scientists to teach them. This proved to be extraordinarily difficult for several reasons. First, computer science PnDs were scarce. Most computer science doctoral programs were relatively new and many graduate institutions didn’t have one. Furthermore, PhDs had a lot of opportunities outside of teaching and usually these were considerably more lucrative. Second, Calvin’s religious screen was very fine and so the college tended to mostly hire its own graduates. But there were very few alums at that time who had computer science PhD. Third, faculty salaries were entirely based on degree and years of experience. It was difficult to compete with institutions that had negotiating room. A few candidates were lost to other institutions because of salary alone. Fourth, Calvin expected a PhD for tenure-track positions so strong candidates with only Masters degrees could only be offered term positions. Fifth, Calvin’s hiring process was Byzantine. A candidate needed to come to campus three times before receiving an offer – for a departmental interview, for an interview with the Professional Status Committee, and for an interview with the Board of Trustees. This final interview was in May but potential candidates often had firm offers from other institutions in January.</p>
<p>A final factor complicating the search for computer scientists and for department faculty generally was that the college was being very conservative in creating tenure-track positions. Though the department had teaching capacity for 14 full-time faculty members in 1980, it had just 10 tenure-track positions (one filled by Stob who wouldn’t arrive until 1981). This conservatism was caused by the serious fluctuations in enrollment during the 1980s and 1990s. The following graph shows the number of FTIACs (first-time in any college students) over the twenty year period. Each year during this time the college budgeted conservatively, never planning on more that 900 or so FTIACs and this meant that new positions were often at most term positions.</p>

</p>
</div>
<p>All these factors conspired to make it quite difficult to hire computer scientists. But one strategy that turned out to be successful was to hire mathematics PhDs who had retrained as computer scientists. David Laverell actually spent a few years in industry and started in 1984. Jim Bradley came in 1986 and Earl Fife in 1988. In each case, the PhD, even though it was not in computer science, qualified them for tenure-track appointments and their prior experience was honored in determining their starting salary. All three of these faculty members would stay at Calvin for the rest of their career, eventually with joint appointments in mathematics and the eventual computer science department.
Calvin finally hired a PhD computer scientist, Joel Adams, in 1989. The second, Keith Vader Linden, would come in 1996.</p>
<p>While the college enrollment fluctuated, enrollment in the department increased over the two decades. This was due in large part to the increase in mathematics course-taking by students in other departments. The introduction of professional programs with significant mathematics requirements and the addition of mathematics requirements in other programs provided a steady stream of students for the department. (We describe these trends below.) This meant that the department was able to hire. Whereas there were 13 faculty positions in 1980, there were 16 in 1999 (of which four were joint with Computer Science and two were term). Since there were additionally three faculty members in the computer science department, this was really a growth of six positions in total. In fact, the department hired 45 faculty members to either term or tenure-track positions from 1980-1999. (This constant hiring placed considerable burden on the department including the department chair and, inevitably, led to some hires to term positions that weren’t especially successful). Retirements in this period included Kuipers (1986), Sinke (1991), Zwier (1996), and Van Zwalenberg (1999). Tragically, Paul Boonstra passed away in 1987 due to leukemia. Fortunately, the department had just hired Gary Talsma to be a second chair in the area of mathematics education so he stepped into the leadership postion immediately.</p>
<p>Tenure-track hires in these two decades included Wayne Dyksen, Jim Bradley, Gene Klassen, David Laverell, Gary Talsma, Jan Koop, Earl Fife, Xiang Dong Ye, John Ferdinands, Yousceek Jeong, Randy Pruim, Rikki Wagstrom, Jim Turner, and Mark Hanisch. While all previous tenure-track hires had been Calvin graduates, only four of these were. All were PhDs and five of these had considerable college teaching experience elsewhere. Koop and Wagstrom were the first two female tenure-track hires. Talsma and Koop were hired to serve the needs of mathematics education. Jeong was a statistician. Fife, Bradley and Laverell were hired primarily to support computer science. Together, these 13 brought considerable diversity, complementary specialty strengths, and some greatly needed consistency among the many term appointees that came and went.
Eight of these 13 would either retire from Calvin or are still teaching in the department.</p>

</h2>
<p>The department had outgrown its original allotment of six offices immediately and by 1980 there was really no place to put new faculty. In 1981, for example, new faculty occupied the offices of faculty on sabbatical that year. There were not enough classrooms in the science building for all the departments teaching there and there were no classrooms particularly appropriate for teaching computer science. Thus in Fall 1982 the department moved to a dormitory, Timmer Hall, a newly constructed addition to Heyns Hall. Timmer was constructed based on anticipated enrollment growth. When that didn’t immediately materialize, there was space available. The department was moved to one wing (the Hall was V-shaped with two wings) and occupied the basement and first floor. Female students occupied the second floor above the department and the entire other wing. Having offices in a girls dorm did present a few logistical issues (and one or two awkward moments). The Dean of Women thought it inappropriate for faculty to be in their offices in the evening and some negotiation was necessary. The actual facilities turned out to meet the needs of the department well. Each faculty member had a dorm room (and shared a bathroom with one other faculty member), Two rooms in the basement were repurposed to a small classroom and the mathematics library (which housed current periodicals and back issues). One “coffee kitchen” was converted to a department office and the other was retained as a place for faculty to have coffee or lunch. The move to Timmer Hall separated the department from the Science Building so made it more difficult to rely on the division’s secretary. Thus, the department hired its first secretary, Bess Exoo. Separated from the Science Building, the department had difficulty finding classrooms to teach its courses. The classroom in the basement of Timmer Hall was appropriate for small classes like Topology and Logic but mathematics classes were offered in every academic building on campus during the Timmer Hall years.</p>
<p>Timmer Hall was temporary. In 1985, the college opened North Hall, an addition to the Science Building. The department moved into the office space on the second floor that it still occupies today. Five new classrooms in North Hall were designed to fit the needs of mathematics teaching. A room was set aside as the “Faculty Computer Room” not anticipating that by the time that faculty occupied North Hall, faculty would generally have computers in their offices. A computer classroom was constructed in the basement.</p>

</h2>
<p>In 1996, the Department of Mathematics proposed that it split into two separate departments: the Department of Computer Science and the Department of Mathematics and Statistics. The proposal to the administration put the situation this way:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The computer science program has been well-served by being part of the larger Department of Mathematics and Computer Science. The larger size of the Department enabled more people to be involved in program development, faculty development, and student advising. It allowed the department to continue to offer small classesin computer science because of the larger classes in mathematics. (For many years, the student-faculty ratio in the computer science portion of the department offerings was much lower than that of mathematics.) It allowed committee work and administrative responsibilities to be handled by others while the computer science faculty attended to curriculum development. Mathematicians even participated in writing a grant proposal for laboratory facilities for computer science.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>However it is also true that the program can now be considered to be a mature one and potentially self-supporting and independent. Student-faculty ratios in the two subdepartments have been nearly equal for the past four years. The current interest in computer science seems more stable than the rather volatile nature
of the interest of the early eighties. Curriculum and advising issues are almost completely independent of those in the mathematics department. Two Ph.D. computer scientists are now on staff. Except for a need for joint appointments that will exist until the current faculty members that teach in both areas retire and except for some shared resources the
programs can function independently.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Adams, Vander Linden, and Nyhoff moved to the new department while Bradley, Fife, Laverell, and Leestma received joint appointments to the two departments. With Fife’s retirement in 2013, the two departments finally became completely separate.</p>

<span class="header-section-number">4.5</span> The Growth of Professional Programs<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#the-growth-of-professional-programs"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>The mathematics department had always been a “service” department, serving the needs of other departments and the general education program. But the 1980s saw new professional programs being introduced and ongoing programs reexamining and increasing their mathematics cognate requirements.</p>
<p>The biggest change of this nature was the introduction in 1984 of a four-year engineering degree, a BSE. Calvin had always had pre-engineering students and in 1980 students could find a three-year plan of courses that would prepare them for completing an engineering degree at another institution (often Michigan) in three or four semesters. Upon completing such a program at another school, Calvin awarded such students a Bachelors Degree in Engineering and Letters. This three-year plan included the two-year mathematics sequence (three semesters of calculus and one of differential equations) and a third-year technical elective which could be taken in mathematics. These four or five courses from each engineering student were an important component of the department’s overall enrollment. Approximately 30 students a year were completing the three-year program in the early 1980s. By 1984, it became apparent that entry into other schools by transfer was becoming more competitive or, at least, not routine and the Calvin Engineering Department introduced a four-year degree program as an alternative. While the original proposal anticipated that many students would still opt to complete their program at other institutions, immediately essentially all engineering students stayed at Calvin to complete their degree. Calvin graduated its first engineers in the new program in 1985. The four-year program included an advanced mathematics elective so all these students took five mathematics courses. Additionally, since a minor in mathematics could be had with six courses, many engineering students added a sixth mathematics course. Not only were students taking more mathematics but also the program became quite an effective recruiting tool and enrollment increased so that by 1999 there were 115 entering freshmen starting the engineering programming and 302 students overall in the programs.</p>
<p>Increasing enrollment in the engineering department was, of course, a blessing for the department in that it ensured increasing enrollment in mathematics courses though college enrollment and the number of mathematics majors fluctuated. On the other hand, this caused increasing challenges for the department in that the enrollment in several courses became dominated by engineering students and their needs were not always congruent with those of majors in mathematics and the other sciences.</p>
<p>Another professional program that required additional departmental resources was the education program. For many years, the department taught prospective high school mathematics teachers. Paul Boonstra and Gary Talsma were responsible for the supervision of these students in the directed teaching semester and there were as many as a dozen teachers in a given year. But the 1980s saw considerable attention being given to the mathematics preparation of elementary school teachers. Throughout the 1970s and early 1980s, the department was teaching a course intended for elementary teachers. While the course received core credit, it was optional in the program. In 1986, the department introduced a two course sequence, Mathematics 221 and 222 (222 was a half-course) designed to be integrated contents-methods courses for elementary education. Mathematics 221 was roughly arithmetic and 222 was geometry and a little statistics. In 1990, 222 became a full course and from then on all elementary education students took both 221 and 222. By the mid 1990s, the department was offering 6 sections of Mathematics 221 and 5 of Mathematics 222 each year which was just about two FTE of faculty worth of teaching. Jan Koop, a mathematics education specialist, joined the department in 1989 and Talsma and Koop would be the mathematics education team for many years. Others in the department helped in teaching Mathematics 221 and 222.</p>

<span class="header-section-number">4.6</span> The Mathematics Major<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#the-mathematics-major"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>In 1980, all majors were expected to take three semesters of calculus and a semester of differential equations. Since at that time, high school calculus was still pretty uncommon, this determined the first two years of the mathematics program. This requirement had not changed since 1961. In 1982, in a major curricular revision, the department introduced three new courses (200-level courses in applied linear algebra and statistics and a second semester of real analysis). The department also renumbered most courses according to a “rational” renumbering scheme by which the second digit of the course number indicated the area of mathematics of the course (analysis-6, algebra-5, applied mathematics-3, education-2, statistics-4, advanced mathematics-8). At the same time, the department defined the major to be two semesters of calculus, two semesters of 200-level mathematics, abstract algebra, three other 300-level courses, and a junior-senior level interim in mathematics. This gave students effectively four choices for their two sophomore-level courses. More on the evolution of the mathematics major over time is included in a separate chapter.</p>

<div id="teaching-loads" class="section level2" number="4.7">
<h2>
<span class="header-section-number">4.7</span> Teaching Loads<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#teaching-loads"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>In 1967, with the switch to the 4-1-4 calendar, the teaching load was defined as seven courses (3-1-3). While in many departments this load consisted of 6 semester courses that met 3 times a week, almost all mathematics courses met 4 times a week. Therefore, mathematics department members were essentially teaching 27 hours compared to 21 hours in some departments such as philosophy. Also, the department had quite a bit of difficulty finding enough interims to teach. Two or three interims were offered each year for the required interim course in the major but mathematics elective interim courses were not popular. So in the early 1980s, the department proposed to then Dean Roger Griffioen that six courses be the standard teaching load in the department and that not every faculty member should be expected to teach an interim courses as one of those six. Griffioen approved with the proviso that an interim “off” be devoted to some professional endeavor such as research. This workload seemed reasonable and equitable although the department didn’t advertise it to colleagues in other departments. By 1997, the college had switched to an hours system for counting course credit and defined the standard teaching load as 21-24 hours putting the mathematics departments loads in the normal zone again.</p>
