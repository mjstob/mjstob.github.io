<p>In the year 2000, there were 1,061 FTIACs in the college, a banner class. The total FTE undergraduate enrollment stood at 4,067. That robust enrollment would be maintained for the next few years - enrollment in 2003 reached an all-time high of 4,124. But from that point on, enrollment decreased almost monotonically so that it barely exceeded 3,000 in 2020. The college did not predict a decline much less such a steep one. This story of robust optimism in the first several years of the century followed by a series of successive local adjustments provides the backdrop of the story of the department from 2000-2020.</p>

</h2>
<p>In some ways, statistics was to 2000 as computer science was to 1980 for the department. The department offered several statistics courses which were well-enrolled but had no PhD statisticians on the faculty and offered no major or minor in statistics.</p>
<p>The department offered four statistics courses in 2000. Mathematics 143 (now Stat 143), an introductory, algebra-based course, enrolled 348 students in 2000. This course was required in business and nursing programs and it also (since 1982) met the core requirement in mathematics. An introductory course such as this had been offered since 1936 and,from 1968 until 1990, a statistics course for business students that also included some finite mathematics was taught. Mathematics 243, introduced in 1983, enrolled 69 students in 2000. A calculus-based introduction to statistics, the course was a popular option for engineering students (as a mathematics elective) and mathematics majors. It was required of secondary education mathematics majors. Mathematics 343 and 344, a two-course sequence in mathematical statistics enrolled 16 and 5 students respectively in 2000. Math 343 was introduced by Sinke in 1960 and the second semester was added in 1979. Together, the department had three introductory courses taught at successively higher levels. All four of these courses are still being taught.</p>
<p>Discussions with the Engineering Department over the first few years of the century, centered on the Engineering Department’s desire for their students to have a broader mathematics experience while at the same time not increasing the number of semester hours of course taking. In 2000, four courses (16 semester hours) in mathematics were required (three semesters of calculus and one of differential equations/linear algebra). The engineers wanted students to take some statistics and ABET accreditation standards expected that. Essentially, the engineers preferred a sophomore year of two courses (eight hours) that included vector calculus, differential equations, linear algebra, and statistics. This was informally dubbed the “4 into 2” problem. In 2003 the department introduced a course (Mathematics 232 - Engineering Mathematics) that attempted to address this need. The sophomore year for engineers then included the two courses Mathematics 231 and 232. Mathematics 232 contained about five weeks of statistics instruction.</p>

<p>This sequence was offered from 2003-2009. The general consensus of both departments was that the sequence did not work well. This story is told more completely in a separate chapter. The resolution finally cam in 2010 when the departments agreed to split Mathematcs 232 into two courses: a more traditional vector calculus course (for 3 semester hours) and a new two-semester hour engineering statistics course. The mathematics cognate for engineers was thereby increased from 16 to 17 semester hours but the new courses (particularly vector calculus) were more focused and more successful.</p>
<p>To meet the needs of a different group, in 2009 the department introduced special sections of Mathematics 143 devoted to biostatistics. In that year, the Biology Department had begun requiring Mathematics 143 as a cognate to their major programs. (Eventually the special sections were offered under a new course number, Mathematics 145.)</p>
<p>Through 2014 it was still the case that students could take one of three different introductory courses in statistics (143, 243, 343) taught at progressively higher levels with progressively more demanding mathematical prerequisites. But a second course was only available to students taking Mathematics 343. In 2015, the department introduced a course, “Applied Data Analysis” (Statistics 245) that had a statistics prerequisite but not a calculus prerequisite giving many more students an opportunity to take a second course in statistics. (In 2015, the department also began designating statistics courses with the STAT rather than MATH designation although they were still housed in the mathematics department.) Finally, in 2016, the department began offering majors and minors in statistics having added two more courses at the 300-level – a course in Bayesian Statistics (STAT 341) and a topics course in Statistics (STAT 385). At the same time, an interdisciplinary team launched a data science major and minors in data science and data analytics with three new courses taught under the DATA designation.</p>

<p>There were 15 department members on tenure-track appointments in 2000. Two of these (Bradley and Fife) were on joint appointments with computer science. Of these 15, 9 would retire over the next 20 years and two would leave the college. So in 2020, just four of the faculty from 2000 remained (Ferdinands, Pruim, Scofield, and Turner). Due to the decrease in enrollment, there were just 10 faculty on tenure-track appointments in 2020, the four above joined by Bolt, Moseley, Kapitula, DeRuiter, Sunukjian, and Klanderman.</p>
<p>Just as it was difficult to hire computer scientists in the 1980s, it was, and remains, difficult to hire statisticians. Ph.D. statisticians have many options, many of them more lucrative than college teaching. Additionally, academic statisticians often prefer to join a statistics department with an active community of statisticians. The problem of being the only or one of a few statisticians at an institution is known as the “isolated statistician” problem and there was even a listserve (ISOSTAT) for the community of such persons.</p>
<p>Just as mathematicians supervised and developed the computer science program in the 1980s, so did they supervise and develop the statistics program. The leader in these efforts was Randy Pruim. Trained as a logician, he shifted his efforts to statistics course and program development and even spent a sabbatical involved in a statistics research community at Michigan. His textbook for Mathematics 343 and 344 was ultimately published in a prestigious series of textbooks published by the American Mathematics Society. Several other department members taught statistics from time to time. The department was also fortunate in having Pam Plantinga and Barb Adams who faithfully taught Mathematics 143 on a parttime basis for many years. In fact, Plantinga taught at least four sections a year of that course for the entire period 2000-2020 we are describing here.</p>
<p>The department hired its first PhD statistician, Yousceek Jeong, in 1994. Unfortunately, Jeong stayed just two years. Kathyrn Jacobsen, an epidemiologist, was hired by the Biology Department in 2005 with the expectation that she would also teach statistics but she stayed only two years. Laura Kapitula was hired in 2009 but she also stayed just three years. Stacy DeRuiter, whose PhD program in Biological Oceanography at MIT contained a lot of statistics, joined the department in 2013 and still serves as the only real statistician in the department.</p>
<p>The retirements of Koop and Talsma in 2018 also made hiring for mathematics education a priority. Dave Klanderman joined the department in 2019 from Trinity Christian College where he had spent many years. With just one person in mathematics education, the department was fortunate that Talsma and Koop stayed on to teach parttime on occasion.</p>
