<p>Calvin University opened in 1876 as a theological school to train ministers for the Christian Reformed Church. The program included four years of preparatory studies (the literary department) and two years of theological studies. The preparatory studies were essentially equivalent to a high-school education. In 1884, the institution began admitting other students to the literary department, including prospective teachers. Eventually the preparatory program would be offered in four tracks: Seminary Preparatory, Classical, Modern Classical, and Teachers’ Preparatory. By 1906, the college offered two years of general work beyond the four-year preparatory program and became known as “Calvin Junior College.”</p>
<p>The 1920-21 academic year opened with the institution offering a four-year program (beyond the preparatory school) for the first time. Its completion resulted in the A.B. degree. The college opened its doors with William Rinck as its only mathematics professor. Rinck also served as the college’s registrar in that first year. Rinck was not new to Calvin having spent the previous 15 years teaching in the preparatory school and the junior college.</p>
<p>In the next several chapters, I tell my version of the story of the first hundred years (1920-2020) of the mathematics department. Of course there are many different ways to tell that story. Certainly a lot depends on the documentation at hand. I am relying principally on two sources. The first is college catalogs. All 100 of the college catalogs are available on-line through Calvin’s Office of Student Success. The catalogs are indispensable for documenting the faculty and curriculum. The second source is my own recollection (enhanced by my personal files). I have been associated with the mathematics department for exactly half of those 100 years having arrived as freshman in 1970 to take an Honors Calculus class taught by Larry Nyhoff. Additionally, I was privileged to be a colleague of Carl Sinke and Paul Zwier whose association with the department went back 20 years before mine and who were perfectly capable of regaling us younger faculty with stories of what it was like in the (good?) old days.</p>
<p>I have chosen to divide the 100 years into four eras. These span the periods 1920-1960, 1960-1980, 1980-2000, and 2000-2020. Of course divisions such as these are artificial just as is the sorting of people into generations (Boomers, Gen X, Millenials, etc.). Change in an academic department is not exactly a continuous function. Each academic year serves as a sort of a jump discontinuity with new students, new faculty, and perhaps curricular change. The divisions that I have made correspond to major curricular shifts. Of course change was more gradual than the bright lines that I have drawn suggest. Some might want to change these boundaries or add eras. But it seems to me that looking at the department through the lens of the four themes that I propose adds to understanding beyond what simply a year to year recounting of people and events might do. Anyway, it’s my story so I’ll tell it my way.</p>
<p>The next four chapters cover the four eras that I have defined above. But,
in thinking about this broad history of the department, I identified several issues and themes that deserved separate treatment. These are covered in later chapters.</p>
<p>I have used the catalog as my “source of truth” concerning faculty and curriculum. There are a couple of causes of systematic errors in relying on the catalog for faculty information. First, the catalog for an academic year was necessarily published before the school year began. Before 1950, the catalog was published in the spring of the preceding academic year. It was called the Yearbook and contained information on the current academic year as well as the calendar and courses for the upcoming year. In later years, the catalog was published sometime in the summer. In either case, the listing of faculty did not necessarily reflect final hiring decisions made in the spring. Second, the definition of membership on the faculty changed over time. In later years, particularly after 1970, the college used many faculty members in one- or two-year term positions. These faculty members had official faculty appointments and were listed, whenever possible, as members of the faculty in the catalog. In earlier years, faculty membership was held somewhat more tightly so that persons teaching in a department might not be listed as members of the faculty. For example, the 1955 catalog list two persons as teaching in mathematics who are not listed in the official list of faculty members in the catalog. Part-time instructors were usually not mentioned in the catalog at all. The catalog is, of couse, more dependable as regards curricular change since the main purpose of a college catalog is to give the “official” descriptions of courses and programs. Even so, the catalog is a better indicator of when courses were introduced than when they were last offered. Courses sometimes stayed on the books long after their last offering.</p>
