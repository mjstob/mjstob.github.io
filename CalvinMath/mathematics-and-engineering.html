<p>Calvin has always had an engineering program. In 1920, students studied two years at Calvin before finishing their degree at an engineering school, usually the University of Michigan. By the 1940s, the program had become what is commonly called a 3+2 program – three years at Calvin and two at an engineering school. Calvin even gave an undergraduate degree to students who completed such a 3+2 progam. In 1985, Calvin offered a four-year engineering program for the first time that resulted in a BSE degree. In most years of Calvin’s existence (all except perhaps some years during the 1970s) there were actually more engineering students in each class than mathematics majors. By the laste 1990s, over 100 first-year students would start the engineering program each year although not nearly so many would complete it.</p>
<p>Since engineering students always took at least four courses in the department, the department always needed to negotiate the content and scheduling of those courses with the engineering department. While in general these negotiations were collegial, at times they caused the department to make compromises that were uncomfortable. One challenge is that most courses that engineering students take serve other students as well, including mathematics majors, and their needs cannot be ignored. This challenge became greater as the number of engineering students greatly increased in the 1980s and as the engineering department felt more pressure from its accreditation agency, ABET, to include certain topics in the curriculum.
Besides the challenge of providing mathematics courses that fit the engineering program, another challenge has always been the wide range of preparation of engineering students in mathematics.</p>

</h2>
<p>From 1920, when the college offered a four-year program, until 1985 when the engineering program first offered a four year degree, pre-engineering students and mathematics majors took the same four-course introductory sequence in mathematics. Before 1961, that included two semesters of analytic geometry and two semesters of calculus. By the late 1950s, the engineering program would also require a differential equations courses resulting in a five-course mathematics cognate. After 1961, three semesters of calculus and one semester of differential equations would be the standard first- and second-year sequence. A technical elective provided a possible fifth mathematics course.</p>
<p>The BSE degree, introduced in 1985, continued to require the four-course package of calculus and differential equations and also required students to take an “advanced mathematics elective”. That elective was usually chosen from among statistics, partial differential equations, and complext variables but engineers sometimes chose other courses for this elective (such as abstract algebra) particularly if they wanted to minor in mathematics (by taking a sixth course). Since by 1985, the third course in calculus and the differential equations course were not required of mathematics majors, engineering students formed the majority in these courses.</p>
<p>By the early 2000s, the engineering department was addressing a perceived pressure to include more engineering courses in its program as well as to include more topics in its mathematics cognate. Specifically, the engineering department asked the mathematics department to offer a four-course sequence that addressed all the topics of the three semester calculus sequence, differential equations, linear algebra, and statistics. After a long negotiation, a four-course sequence acceptable to the enginnering department was implemented in 2003. This sequence included the standard calculus I course, a calculus II course that included some topics previously included in calculus III, a sophomore “engineering mathematics” course that was approximately 8 weeks of multivariable caclulus and five weeks of statistics, and a differential equations/linear course.</p>
<p>The department offered this four course sequence for six years. However, it became clear from the very beginning that there were some serious difficulties with this sequence. One problem was that the new calculus II was now “nonstandard.” Not only did this make the course more difficult for students but it also presented problems for advanced placement students. Students who completed the BC syllabus and normally would be placed in calculus III were now missing some topics and had a more difficult time starting in that course. A more serious problem was that the statistics/multivariable calculus course proved to be quite difficult to teach. It was difficult to construct a syllabus for (or find a textbook for) the statistics portion and it was difficult to do enough multivariable calculus to prepare the engineering students for the physics cognate.</p>
<p>In 2010, the two departments agreed on revisions to the sequence. The Calclus II course reverted to a more standard course. A standalone statistics course was created for engineers. While this course was only a two-semester hour course, it still had a substantially greater coverage of statistics than was possible in the engineering mathematics course and, since it was a standaloIt also provided the opportunity for engineers to take a four hour statistics course to meet the statistics cognate if they had room in their program (for example, if they had AP calculus credit). The multivariable calculus course was reinstated but a three-semester hour version was introduced. This was done by teaching the standard multivariable calculus course (which was four hours) but arranging topics so that engineering students could leave the course after 10 weeks with the what was necessary to proceed in the program. Effectively, this changed the cognate requirement from 16 semester hours to 17 semester hours.</p>

</h2>
<p>Since 1961, the mathematics cognate for the Engineering program has included three semesters of Calculus. By 1966, the engineering program was constructed assuming that students took Calc I in the first semester of the first year. But not all engineering students are equally ready for Calc I. Of course, this is not particularly an engineering student problem but it is particularly consequential for engineering students due to the prerequisite structure of the program. Students who don’t start Calc I in the first semester of their first year usually need a full extra year to complete the program (either the 3+2 program of 1961-1985 or the four-year degree program started in 1985). The mathematics department has used various strategies over the year to place students in an appropriate mathematics course and to construct pathways that might allow students to “catch-up” to their classmates who started in Calc I.</p>
<p>From 1961 until 1991, the prerequisite for Calc I was expressed in various ways but was essentially two years of high school algebra and at least a semester of high school trigonometry. Along with the expected course in geometry, this resulted in an expectation of 3.5 years of high school mathematics. Many students, especially in the early years of this period, came from high schools that did not offer a fourth year of high school mathematics. Many others elected not to take that fourth year of mathematics in lieu of other electives at the high school. It was not necessarily the case that high school students expecting to study engineering realized the amount of mathematics that they would need to take. Throughout this period, the department offered courses in algebra and trigonometry (sometimes in two separate courses and sometimes in one combined course) so that students could start calculus in the spring of their first year or the fall of their second year. By 1979 this course was called Precalculus Mathematics (110) and was listed as an alternative prerequisite to Calc I. Again, students taking this path were effectively a year behind in the three year program</p>
<p>In 1982, the department began offering Calc I (Mathematics 161 at the time) during the interim term. This gave engineering students the possibility of “catching up” to their cohort by taking Mathematics 110 in the fall and calculus during the interim. Calculus in 15 days was challenging. The course met 8:30-5 and included both lecture sessions and supervised homework sessions. Usually two instructors were assigned to teach it. The success rate of students in this track was not great.</p>
<p>By 1992, more students were coming to Calvin with four years of high school mathematics and the department realized that students with four years of mathematics in high school were in general more successful in the course. The department formally set the the prerequisite for calculus to be four years of high school mathematics and the prerequisite for pre-calculus to be three years of high school mathematics. Realizing that not all high schools are equal, the department also instituted a placement test that students with four years of high school mathematics took during the orientation period before classes began. The department created a version of Calculus that was one and one-quarter course units for students deemed by the placement test to be not quite ready for calculus. Thus there were two pathways for those not prepared for the standard Calc I course (161). Students could either take 110 in the fall and then 161 during the interim or take 160 in the fall.</p>
<p>In 1998, the department determined that Mathematics 160 was not sufficient to make students ready for Mathematics 162 (Calc II). Therefore the department created a two-course sequence, 159 and 160 to be taken during the fall and interim terms to be a pre-calculus/calculus I sequence for those students who had four years of high school mathematics but were deemed by the placement test not to be ready for 161. The department also stopped teaching 161 in the interim thereby determining that there was no path for students to catchup who started in pre-calculus. These changed were made after examining the performance of students who started in 110 - essentially none of these students were successful in catching up and completeing the four-year engineering program on time. The department stopped offering 110 in 2015.</p>
<p>The department stopped offering the fall-interim sequence of pre-calculus in 2020. Instead, students with four years of high school mathematics entered Calc I. However, a new one-hour course called Calculus I supplemental instruction was offered to be taken alongside Calc I. Just 12 students enrolled that first year. In 2021, the college eliminated the interim term so the strategy of using interim to catch up is not available anyway.</p>
<p>It is fair to say that the above story has two themes that are constantly in tension. The first is the increasing acknowledgement that success in calculus demands a solid four-year high school preparation (or its equivalent). The second is that starting in anything other than Calculus I is deemed very undesirable for engineering students. The departments attempts to enforce the former while acknowledging the latter led to a variety of strategies for placement and curriculum.</p>
