<p>In the 1980s, the department and the college began to place increased emphasis on faculty research both in hiring and in decisions on reappointment and tenure. While there were several faculty members engaged in scholarship as early as the 1940s (John DeVries in Chemistry, for example), it is fair to say that having an active research program was not a requirement for tenure and not necessarily an important criteria in hiring. This varied quite a bit by department.</p>
<p>The mathematics department began hiring PhDs in 1960 and every tenure-track hire after that (except for Jack Kuipers) had a PhD. But it is fair to say that the department made a push to hire faculty with active research programs only beginning with the hires of Venema (1979) and Stob (1981). Venema and Stob each came to the college from postdoctoral research positions and with NSF grants in hand.</p>
<p>While individual departments varied in their emphasis on faculty research, the college began in the early 1980s to institute programs to support and encourage faculty research. The most important and effective of these was the Calvin Research Fellowship (CRF) program. A CRF was a reduction in teaching load to provide time for a faculty member to pursue a scholarly project. The program started modestly in 1982 with just five course reductions college-wide. Stob and Venema were each awarded one. The program quickly grew and over the years many department members have had multiple “units” of CRFs.<br>
Also, in the 1980s, the college placed more emphasis on the notion that a sabbatical was for support of a scholarly project and not just for a semester of relief. In turn, the college tried to fund the sabbatical program at a high level so that all worthy sabbatical projects would be funded. These two programs - the CRF program and a robust sabbatical program - remain important and effective tools for supporting faculty research.</p>
<p>Besides the internal suppport for research, the college gradually devoted more support and encouragement for faculty to pursue external funding. It is fair to say that in the 1980s, the college still did not support faculty with grants well. Faculty were expected to do their own grant accounting and to find their own sources of funding. By the late 1990s however, the college provided considerable more support for faculty to apply for grants including the creation of a Dean for Research position and an office of Grants and External Programs with personnel to help navigate funding agency requirements. Several mathematics faculty over the years have had substantial external support from agencies such as NSF, the Michigan Department of Education, and the John Templeton Foundation.</p>

<h2>
<span class="header-section-number">7.2</span> Departmental Statement on Research<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#departmental-statement-on-research"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>In 1991, the {} Committee on Faculty Research sent to the Professional Status Committee entitled {} That committee was appointed as a result of the 1987 college strategic plan that called for investment in faculty research. The {} committee determined the need to define more carefully what was to be expected of faculty in the area of research and scholarship. The Professional Status Committee, upon the recommendation of the {} committee, noted that the nature of and expectations for research did and probably should vary by department and mandated that departments create statements on research that addressed four questions:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>What do research and scholarship mean in that department?</li>
<li>How do research and scholarship contribute to the mission of
the college?</li>
<li>What methods should be used to evaluate research
and scholarship of members of the department? and</li>
<li>What means will the department use to promote research and scholarship?</li>
</ol>
<p>Under the leadership of Gerard Venema, the college created a statement that, with some light revision, still serves the department well today. The two major features of that statement are its responses to question 1 and 3.</p>
<p>The department chose to use a broad definition of research and scholarship. So, while traditional research such as that supported by the NSF was included, so were research programs that concerned pedagogy or Christian perspectives on mathematics. The statement however emphasized that ideally any such program should result in publication, broadly conceived, to an external audience.</p>
<p>The department also established a method of evaluating research. At each reappointment occasion, the department appoints a two person committee to evaluate (and give feedback on) the research program of the faculty member. At the same time, the department also established a similar process of a two-person committee evaluating teaching. These committees, when they work worked well helped the candidate understand better the expectations of the department.</p>

<p>By the 1980s, it was not uncommon for there to be students engaged in research projects in the summer, especially in the chemistry and physics department. These projects were normally funded by external grants. In the late 1980s, the science division began to provide funds to support such students and this has grown into a large program of student summer research. Funds come from several endowments and occasionally some division-wide external grants.</p>
<p>The department’s first foray into summer student research was through a Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) grant from the NSF. This grant was joint with Hope College and it allowed Stob and Venema to support students during the summer of 1992. Students were selected to participate in the Hope-Calvin program from external applicants and from Calvin and Hope students. Half the students had to be from outside the two institutions. The summer program had a component of instruction (with some external speakers), social activities, and research. Stob and Venema each had a non-Calvin student as well as one or two Calvin students. Stob’s student Tom Nevins, a Notre Dame undergraduate, had particular success. His summer project resulted in a publication in a peer-reviewed journal. Nevins would go on to graduate school at Chicago and a career at Illinois. Nevins in fact proved the opposite of what Stob expected would be the result of the project. While Hope continued the REU, Stob and Venema only participated that first year.</p>
<p>As science division funds increased and faculty members received external grants that funded student research, several faculty routinely supervised Calvin students in summer research projects. Several of these student projects resulted in publications and some students presented at meetings such as MathFest or the Michigan Section of the MAA.The department also encourages students to apply for off-campus research positions in the summer. The availability of such positions greatly increased over the past 20 years due to the significant expansion of the REU program. The culmination of a summer research position is a poster presentation at the annual science division poster session in the fall. Students from across the division prepare a poster that is displayed in the lobby of DeVries Hall. Students are available to answer questions about their posters.</p>
