<p>There are several reasons why 1960 (or thereabout) represents a natural division in the evolution of the department. First, rapid enrollment increases meant that there were more students to take mathematics and therefore more faculty positions available. College enrollment was only 690 in 1945-46 but grew steadily after the war so that in 1960 enrollment topped 2,000 for the first time. In just five more years, enrollment was to be almost 3,000. Second, to fill the positions open due to increased enrollment, the college was regularly hiring new faculty and, contrary to previous custom, many of these had Ph.D. degrees. Carl Sinke in 1957 and Paul Zwier in 1960 joined Muyskens and Tuls, doubling the size of the department. Sinke and Zwier were the first mathematics faculty members with doctoral degrees having both earned Ph.Ds. from Purdue and they came with fresh ideas concerning curriculum and pedagogy.</p>
<p>The third reason for identifying 1960 as a watershed year is an external force – Sputnik. In 1957, the Soviet Union successfully launched a satellite that orbited the earth. This event shocked the nation’s scientific establishment as it realized that the U.S. was not necessarily preeminent in science and mathematics. The nation immediately invested in improving science and mathematics education. The National Defense Education Act of 1958 established many programs designed for the “expansion and improvement of educational programs to meet critical national needs” and was focused on science, mathematics, and foreign language instruction. The Act set up a federal student loan program for higher education and also provided grants to states for developing programs to strengthen mathematics, science, and foreign language instruction. High quality and modern science texts were created for high school students in the 1960s. The “new mathematics’’ reforms were introduced at all levels. In fact, in the early 1960s Sinke and Zwier ran several NSF-funded summer workshops for teachers at Calvin. And many high school and elementary school teachers participated in NSF-sponsored summer workshops in science and mathematics. By the late 1960s, the physics and mathematics majors at Calvin had become enormously popular.</p>

</h2>
<p>The 1960 school year started with Muyskens, Tuls, Zwier and Sinke on the faculty. Muyskens would retire in 1962.
Over the course of the next decade, the department would add George Van Zwalenberg (PhD, Berkeley, 1968), Paul Boostra (Ph D, Michigan State,1970), Jack Kuipers (MSE, Michigan, 1966) , Larry Nyhoff (Ph D, Michigan State, 1969) , and Sandford Leestma (PhD, New Mexico State, 1969). All of these were Calvin graduates of the early 1960s. Boonstra was the first hire in the area of mathematics education and would go on to supervise hundreds of prospective secondary school mathematics teachers in his 20-year tenure in the department. Nyhoff and Leestma were trained in mathematics but would play an instrumental role later in establishing the computer science program at Calvin (a story told in the next chapter). Jack Kuipers, the only non PhD in the group, had a masters degree in electrical engineering and taught applied mathematics, often to prospective engineers. Tuls retired in 1973, but all these other faculty members were still around in 1980.</p>
<p>Late in the 1970s, Jom Jager (Ph D, Chicago, 1971), Daryl Brink (Ph D, Michigan State, 1973), and Gerard Venema (Ph D, Utah, 1975) joined the department. Also through the late 1970s, the department began to rely on term (non-tenure-track) appointments to expand the faculty without making long-term commitments. Thus, during the 1979-80 academic year, there were 9 faculty on tenure-track appointments and 4 on term appointments. (Brink was on a term appointment that would later be converted to tenure-track.)</p>

</h2>
<p>Of the courses being taught in 1959, all but three of them had been introduced in the 1920s. These three were the statistics course introduced in 1936, the business mathematics course introduced in 1948, and an advanced calculus course introduced in 1957. Of the eight original courses, seven were still being offered. The department (probably primarily Sinke and Zwier) realized a major overhaul was in order. In 1960, the department introduced a Mathematical Statistics course (taught primarily by Sinke over the next couple of decades) and a Modern Algebra course (taught primarily by Zwier).</p>
<p>In 1961, the department effected a major curriculum revision. The most important change was the elimination of the two course analytic geometry sequence (courses 5 and 6 of 1920). In its place, the calculus sequence was expanded to three courses and analytic geometry was incorporated in all three courses (and the titles of the courses). This effectively made calculus the beginning of the major sequence although a course in college algebra was introduced for those students not prepared for the calculus sequence. (College algebra had been the original course 3 but hadn’t been offered since 1952.) The department changed not only the introductory sequence but also added a significant number of offerings at the upper-level for majors including courses in Linear Algebra and Modern Geometry as well as a two course sequence called Advanced Analysis. This two-course sequence initially contained such topics as vector analysis, Stoke’s Theorem, series, and complex analysis. The two-course sequence was designed to appeal to engineers and scientists as well as mathematics students and its content evolved over time as the needs of students and the syllabus of the third semester of calculus changed. The current successors of this two-course sequence are the courses in partial differential equations and in complex analysis. The mathematics major in 1961 was defined as the “new freshman-sophomore sequence” (three semesters of calculus and one of differential equations) and two additional courses chosen from those numbered 300 or above. This constituted a 24 hour major. Currently, a 24 hour program does not seem like a major but such programs were typical in 1960.</p>
<p>By the end of the 1960s, the college had added five more courses at the 300-level: Topology, Real Analysis, History of Mathematics, Numerical Mathematics, and a second semester of Modern Algebra. In 1963, the college also introduced a course in mathematics for the liberal arts student called “Elements of Modern Mathematics” and Sinke and Zwier would write a text for the course.</p>

</h2>
<p>Just as in the Mathematics Department, other departments across campus were hiring young PhDs who were anxious to modernize the curriculum. In 1965, a committee of the faculty chaired by the Nick Wolterstorff who had joined the faculty in 1959 prepared a report called “Christian Liberal Arts Education.” This report gave a philosophical argument for a complete overhaul of the college curriculum, academic calendar, and even credit assignment practices. The new calendar had two somewhat shortened semesters and a one-month January term sandwiched in between. Essentially all courses were to carry the same credit (one “unit”) and students would typically take 4 courses each semester and one intensive course each January. The new curriculum also included a 17-course set of core curriculum requirements. The proposal also formalized the notion of concentration. Students would henceforth be required to complete a concentration (major) of the department’s specification. (Previously, students needed only complete 24 hours in a department.) Minors were eliminated although group majors were possible for students desiring breadth.</p>
<p>The 4-1-4 plan went online in 1967. The department defined a major to be nine courses: the three calculus courses, differential equations, abstract algebra, three additional 300-level courses. In 1968, the department added the completion of a junior-senior level interim to the major requirements. Faculty members offered a wide range of interim courses those first few years including such courses as graph theory, number theory, celestial mechanics, differential geometry, philosophy of mathematics, and elementary computer programming.</p>

<p>From 1920 to 1967, the mathematics department was housed in the science building on the Franklin Campus. Beginning in 1962 however, the college gradually relocated to the (current) Knollcrest campus and in 1968 the new science building was opened. (The science building has been added to twice since – with North Hall and DeVries Hall). The mathematics department had a suite of offices on the first floor. This was the first time faculty members had private offices. There were six offices in the suite and other mathematics faculty members were dispersed throughout the rest of the building. The facilities were important for fostering greater student-faculty interaction. With private offices just around the corner from classrooms, faculty could easily hold office hours and it was not uncommon to see lines in front of the various calculus instructors offices. The mathematics department was to remain in the science building until it outgrew the space available in the early 1980s.</p>

<h2>
<span class="header-section-number">3.5</span> Departmental Traditions<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#departmental-traditions"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>The 1960s were a time when important departmental traditions and ways of working were solidified. Given the number of mathematics majors, there were enough activity to form a vibrant community and the department worked very intentionally at this. One extraordinarily important tradition is the mathematics department colloquium. Established at least as early as 1967 and always held on Thursday afternoon at 3:30, the colloquium featured a talk often by a visitor from outside Calvin. Refreshments precede the talk. While attendance was not mandatory until the 1980s, many upper-level majors routinely attended and, since there were a lot of majors, SB 101 was often close to full. Several visitors each year came as sort of recruiters for graduate school. This was invaluable for students considering graduate school as it was difficult to get current, dependable information of graduate programs.</p>
<p>Another important tradition is the department picnic. Each fall, the department hosts current mathematics students for a picnic after classes (on a Thursday currently although Friday originally). The tradition is that faculty members supply desserts and side dishes and grill meat. Until cost became prohibitive, the meat was steak (now it’s burger and hot dogs).
The picnic was held at the Christian Reformed Recreation Center before it folded which allowed for a faculty-student softball game and touch football. The picnic eventually moved on-campus which helped to improve attendance as finding transportation was not necessary.</p>
<p>Another tradition is the participation of students in mathematical problem-solving competitions. Calvin has had students participating in the Putnam Competition each year since the early 1960s. While participation has decreased over time, in some years Calvin had more than 30 participants in this competition. A highlight was the 1973 team of Steve Haan, David VanBaak, and David Cok (all physics majors) which finished twentieth. Other competitions have been added over the years including the Lower Michigan Mathematics Competition (started by Kalamazoo College), the Fall Take-Home Challenge (started by Alma College), and the International Competition in Modeling. A Calvin team of David Cole, Loren Haarsma, and Jack Snoeyink received the highest award in the first edition of the International Competition in Modelling in 1985.</p>
