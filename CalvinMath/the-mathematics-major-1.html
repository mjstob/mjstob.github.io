</h1>
<p>This section is an attempt to document all the changes in the requirements for a mathematics major over the first 100 years of the department. The department has had a major since 1920 and a major for secondary education students since 1967. Here we describe all the changes in each of these two. Additionally, the department has had a major for elementary education students, a statistics major, an actuarial science major, and, with computer science, a data science major.</p>
<div id="the-1920-1926-major" class="section level2" number="9.1">
<h2>
<span class="header-section-number">9.1</span> The 1920-1926 Major<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#the-1920-1926-major"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>In 1920, students really didnâ€™t major in mathematics but rather completed a group major in the so-called Group II: Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry, Zoology, Botany, Psychology, and Logic. Within this group students needed to take four semester courses of three hours each in two departments. So a mathematics major would be considered 12 hours in at least four courses. Two courses in analytic geometry and two in calculus would be the normal way to complete this requirement (although it would comprise 16 hours).</p>
</div>
<div id="the-1927-1948-major" class="section level2" number="9.2">
<h2>
<span class="header-section-number">9.2</span> The 1927-1948 Major<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#the-1927-1948-major"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>In 1927, the major requirements were revised but still used the group framework. Logic was removed from the group. Students were required to take 36 hours in their major group with at least 21 hours in one of the departments of that group (and 12 in another). The two departments were called the major and minor departments of the major group. So a mathematics major would consist of 21 hours of courses. The analytic geometry and calculus courses comprised 16 of these hours. Additional electives included differential equations, theory of equations, and solid analytic geometry.</p>
</div>
<div id="the-1949-1966-major" class="section level2" number="9.3">
<h2>
<span class="header-section-number">9.3</span> The 1949-1966 Major<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#the-1949-1966-major"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>In 1949, using the same framework, the requirement remained at 36 hours total for the major group but the student was required to take 24 hours (instead of 21) in one of the departments.</p>
</div>
<div id="the-1967-major" class="section level2" number="9.4">
<h2>
<span class="header-section-number">9.4</span> The 1967 Major<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#the-1967-major"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>With the change to the 4-1-4 curriculum, 1967 was the first year that departments specified the requirements for their own programs of concentration (which was what majors were called).</p>
<p>The mathematics major was eight courses: three semesters of calculus, differential equations, abstract algebra, and three 300-level electives. The department also specified the secondary education mathematics major to include geometry, statistics, and topology (!) as the three 300-level electives, and also to include an interim course in mathematics. Perhaps topology was a typo. In any event, that particular requirement was changed the very next year.</p>
</div>
<div id="the-1968-1981-major" class="section level2" number="9.5">
<h2>
<span class="header-section-number">9.5</span> The 1968-1981 Major<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#the-1968-1981-major"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>In 1968, the department made two changes. An interim course was added to the requirements for the general major (making the major nine courses). The topology requirement was changed to a history of mathematics requirement in the secondary education major. The history of mathematics course was new that year and certainly a better option than topology.</p>
</div>
<div id="the-1982-1990-major" class="section level2" number="9.6">
<h2>
<span class="header-section-number">9.6</span> The 1982-1990 Major<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#the-1982-1990-major"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>The 1982 revision to the major opened up the sophomore year and also provided some structure to the choice of 300-level electives. The major included two semesters of calculus, two 200-level mathematics courses, two semesters of the non-credit colloquium, a interim course, and four 300-level courses. The 300-level courses were required to include: a course in algebra, a course in analysis, a course emphasizing applications, and a course emphasizing formal proof. A computer science cognate was also added. (At that time it was a course in Pascal programming.)</p>
<p>The requirements for secondary education students were considerably revised. They simply included two semesters of calculus and seven 200- and 300-level courses chosen with the approval of the advisor. The catalog was eventually edited to indicate that an upper-level mathematics interim course could be included among those seven. Education 356 substituted for the colloquium requirement of the general major.</p>
</div>
<div id="the-1991-2003-major" class="section level2" number="9.7">
<h2>
<span class="header-section-number">9.7</span> The 1991-2003 Major<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#the-1991-2003-major"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>The rather complicated description of the requirements of the general major of the previous nine years caused the department to simplify the statement of the major in 1991. The mathematics major was still eight courses, an approved interim, two semesters of the colloquim, and a computer science cognate. But the eight courses were: two semesters of calculus, two 200-level courses, real analysis, abstract algebra, and two additional 300 level courses.</p>
<p>The secondary education sequence was completely specified. It followed the same form as the general major but the two 200-level courses were specified as statistics (MATH 243) and applied linear algebra (MATH 255). The four 300-level courses were abstract algebra, analysis, history of mathematics, and geometry.</p>
</div>
<div id="the-2004-2019-major" class="section level2" number="9.8">
<h2>
<span class="header-section-number">9.8</span> The 2004-2019 Major<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#the-2004-2019-major"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>With the change from the course unit system to the semester hour system in 1997, the department had been introducing some 3-hour courses while most courses were 4-hours. In 2004, the department changed both the general and secondary education sequence in a way that hours mattered.</p>
<p>In the general major, the department specified that one of the 200-level courses be MATH 256 which was a discrete mathematics/linear algebra combination designed partly with the needs of computer science majors in mind. (In 2017, the requirement would be replaced by MATH 255, an applied linear algebra course) The other 200-level course was chosen from a third semester of calculus, differential equations, or statistics (MATH 243). Four courses were still required at the 300-level including real analysis, abstract or linear algebra, and two courses of at least 7 hours from other 300-level electives.</p>
<p>The secondary education major was changed by substituting MATH 256 for linear algebra, adding MATH 329 (a two-hour course called introduction to teaching secondary school mathematics) and by changing the history requirement to the new perspectives in modern mathematics course (which ahd a strong historical component).
MATH 329 would be replaced by MATH 327, essentially the same course but focusing on middle school, in 2018.</p>
