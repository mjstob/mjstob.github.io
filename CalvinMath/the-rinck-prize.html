<p>The Rinck Prize, named after the first mathematics professor, William Rinck, is the oldest prize in the college. Professor Rinck was 43 years old when he died in an automobile accident along with his young son. Professor Rinck was well-like by his students and his colleagues and over the next few years they contributed $500 that was used to set up a fund to award a prize to an outstanding mathematics student. The fund has grown over the years so that the award is substantial and, aided by an additional substantial donation from Professor Rinck’s daughter, the fund fund now also supports a scholarship.</p>
<p>The first award was given in the spring of 1928. It was awarded to John A. Bolt, a junior student from Raymond, MN. Bolt went on to a career as a chemist in the Chicago area. The catalog description of the prize doesn’t suggest any particular criteria.</p>

<p>By 1930, the catalog describes the criteria in terms of performance in five courses: college algebra, two semesters of analytic geometry, and two semesters of calculus.</p>

<p>The criteria remained the same until 1961 when the department revised the curriculum so that well-prepared students started in calculus. Analytic geometry was no longer required (or offered). The criteria changed to the current statement.</p>

<p>The criteria are, of course, quite open-ended and the faculty often have spirited discussions in trying to determine the winner each year. In the early years, with fewer faculty, all faculty knew all students well and the criteria emphasized performance in five specified courses. As the faculty and number of courses offered grew, it became more difficult to compare the performance of individual students. The department also began to consider performance of students outside the classroom such as in independent research and participation in the colloquium.</p>
<p>One of the consequences of offering a rich set of mathematical electives is that some students take more courses than others. For example, the secondary education mathematics students take a minimal major due to the number of other professional courses that they must take to complete the program (including a whole semester of directed teaching). Also, double majors usually take fewer mathematics courses. The introduction of the Paul Boonstra Memorial Award given to a graduate senior specializing in mathematics education allowed the department to address this first group of students. Paul Boonstra was the first faculty member speicializing in mathematics education.</p>

<p>The list of winners over time gives some insight into the role of mathematics at Calvin over the years. Many of the early winners of the award were not considered mathematics majors. And, since the award was based on coursework through calculus, many non-majors won the prize. Engineering students were prime candidates. Gordon Van Wylen (1940), who would later go on to become the President of Hope College, was an engineering student who completed his engineering degree at Michigan. In the late 1930s and throughout the 1940s, the award usually wnet to a chemistry major. Ted Dirkse (1935) was the first award winner to come back to Calvin as a faculty member. He served the department of chemistry until his retirement. The appeal of chemistry in the 1940s was in large part due to the presence of John (“Doc”) DeVries who had a PhD and a research program. DeVries Hall is named after “Doc” DeVries in honor of his outsized influence on Calvin. Rinck winners of the 1940s inlcuded Charles Dekker (1941) who would have a career as a UC Berkeley chemistry faculty member, John Huizinga (1943) who became an Argonne National Laborator chemist and later received the Calvin College distinguished alumni award, and Calvin professor Herman Broene (1942). Other chemistry professors from this era who won the award include Russel Maatman (1946), Anne DeBoer Deckard (1945), and Harold Van Kley (1953).</p>
<p>The addition of the requirement in 1961 that the prize winner be a mathematics major changed this pattern of chemists winning the award. However, often the winner was a double major. In the early 1970s winners included Steve Haan (1973) who would have a career as a physicist at Lawrence Livermore Lab, and David Cok (1975) who, after receiving a Harvard PhD in Physics, would have a career at Kodak. Chemistry students continued to win the award at a regular clip. Recent award winners who have gone on to pursue chemistry PhDs include Andrea Bootsma (2015) and Grace Johnecheck (2019). Philosophy double major Eddy Chen (2013) is currently a philosophy professor. After the introduction of the computer science major in 1980, several winners were computer scientists including Jack Snoeyink (1985) who received a Stanford PhD in Computer Science and teaches at North Carolina nad Ethan Van Andel (2011) who received a Berkeley PhD and is a software engineer.</p>
<p>Of course a typical career path for a Rinck Prize winner is to earn a PhD in mathematics and to have a career as a mathematics professor. Besides Zwier, Tom Jager (1966), Mike Stob (1974), Wayne Dyksen (1977), Randy Pruim (1988), and Mike Bolt (1994) returned to teach at Calvin. Curiously, three of these (Jager, Stob, and Bolt) received their PhD from Chicago. Dyksen taught at Calvin for three years before moving on to Purdue and, eventually MSU as a computer science professor. Other mathematics PhDs include Ward Bouwsma (1956) who would eventually become an editor of Mathematical reviews, Bob Daverman (19) who served as Associate Secretary of the AMS for many years and won the Calvin distiguished alumni award, and several winners who are still active mathematics professors. PhD statisticians who have won the award include Sharon Lohr (1982), a Fellow of the American Statistical Association, and Paul Vos (1983).</p>
<p>Perhaps mathematics runs in families. Randy Pruim (1988) and his son Jason (2021) are winners. So are Jack Snoeyink (1985) and his daughter Sarah Snoeyink Van Fossen (2010). Tom Jager (1966) along with all three of his daughters Rebekah Jager Arana (1995), Abby Jager (1998), and Leah Jager (2001) were Rinck Prize winners. All three Jager women received PhDs, Rebekah in mathematics from Notre Dame and Abby and Leah in statistics. Evelyn Van Appledorn Oostendorp (1934) was the grandmother of William Oostendorp (1987)!</p>
