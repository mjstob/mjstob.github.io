<p>The college opened in 1920 with 122 students, 14 of them female. The catalog actually lists the names, local addresses, and hometowns of all of these students. Forty-four of these students came from out of state, including from states as far as Washington, Montana, and South Dakota. Students paid tuition which depended on their home state. Tuition was $15 a semester for those students from the midwest and half that for students from west of the Missippi or east of Ohio. Students from Montana, Colorado, New Mexico, or further west paid no tuition. There was a dormitory but most students lived with a host family for around $7 a week.</p>
<p>There were 20 faculty members on the faculty roster listed in the catalog (including President John Hiemenga). One faculty member had a Ph.D. (Peter Hoekstra in History). There was also one female faculty member, Nelly Bosma, who was an Instructor in Biology. William Rinck was the sole faculty member in mathematics. Tragically, in his very first semester of the new four-year college, Professor Rinck died in an auto accident along with his young son. He was replaced by James “Sleepy” Nieuwdorp who had started the year as an instructor in chemistry. Nieuwdorp was to remain in the mathematics department until 1944. For most of those years he was the only mathematics instructor.</p>
<p>The college offered an A.B. degree with a curriculum loosely patterned on that of the Free University of Amsterdam. To receive this degree, students completed 120 hours including 54 hours of what we now call general education and 66 hours of courses chosen from three different groups. (The groups were, roughly, Languages and Literature, Science and Mathematics, and Social Sciences and Philosophy.) Incredibly, 36 of the 87 courses in the 1920 catalog were foreign language courses (Greek, Latin, Dutch, Hebrew, German, and French).
There were prescribed programs for pre-seminary, pre-medicine (three years), pre-engineering (two years), and pre-law (three years). It was still the case that teachers generally stopped after the preparatory school (high school). The college would introduce a two-year “normal” course the next year. There was one pedagogical methods course taught in the preparatory school. Students other than pre-seminary students wanting a four year degree were required to choose a major group and a minor group and complete at least 24 hours in the major group and 20 in the minor group. This basic structure of the major and minor requirements continued until the 1967-68 year when the college introduced the 4-1-4 calendar and radically redesigned the curriculum. The required number of hours in the major and minor gradually increased over these four decades so that by 1960, students were required to choose a 24 hour major in one department, a 12-hour minor in the same group, and 18 hours in a second group.</p>

<p>The mathematics department offered eight different courses.</p>

<p>Not listed here (in error) is course 6, a continuation of course 5, which appears in the 1921 catalog. Courses 7 and 8 were new to the college, but course 1 and course 2 were preparatory school courses and courses 3-6 were taught previously in the junior college.
All these courses would continue to be offered until the late 1950s (with different numbering schemes).
The pre-engineering students were expected to take courses 5, 6, 7, and 8 in their two years and this prepared them to transfer to the University of Michigan. Until the college introduced a four-year engineering program in 1985, this path of two (later, three) years at Calvin followed by two at Michigan would remain a popular path for Calvin students wanting to be engineers.</p>
<p>The two-course sequence in analytic geometry was substantial (some might say tedious). In the 1970s, Carl Sinke would lament the lack of analytic geometry knowledge of his calculus students. He would have taken course 5 and 6 in the late 1940s.
A typical set of problems from the text on analytic geometry indicates the flavor of the work in courses 5 and 6.</p>

</h2>
<p>Sleepy Nieuwdorp (as he was called by former students and colleagues) took over from Rinck in the fall of 1920 and he was to serve as the only faculty member for the next twenty years until Muyskens joined him in 1940. In the first few years that he was with the department, Nieuwdorp introduced several new courses. In 1923 the college added courses in Differential Equations and the Theory of Equations. In 1923, the college also introduced a two-year teacher preparation sequence and so the department added the Teacher’s Course, a course in mathematics for prospective secondary teachers. In 1926, the department added courses in Solid Analytic Geometry and Projective Geometry. The curriculum would not change again until 1936 when the first statistics course was offered.</p>
<p>Students “majored” in mathematics from the very beginning of the college. The 1940 catalog definition of major indicates that a major consists of at least 21 hours. No particular courses are required or specified. The 1940 list of courses shows the orignal eight courses (renumbered) and the five additional courses added over the first two decades.</p>

</h2>
<p>Albert Muyskens joined Nieuwdorp in the fall of 1940. Muyskens was an alum of the junior college, graduating in 1917. He had been on the faculty as an instructor in Physical Education since 1936. He would coach the varsity basketball team from 1936-1945, attaining a 71% winning percentage. Nieuwdorp retired in 1944 and John Tuls would join Muyskens in 1946. Tuls was the first graduate of the college to teach in the department, having graduated in 1928.<br>
These two would serve as the mathematics department for the rest of this “era.”
While enrollment was increasing at a rapid rate after the war (the college enrollment was 690 in the fall of 1945 and 2,016 in 1960) and more students were majoring in mathematics (there were more than 20 majors a year graduating each year in the 1950s), the departments curriculum would remain almost unchanged. The only courses added in the 1940s were a spherical trigonometry course that was offered sporadically from 1945 through 1958 and a Business Mathematics course that was added in 1948. An Advanced Calculus course was added in 1958 but it was only taught twice.</p>
