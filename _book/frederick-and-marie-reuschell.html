<h1><span class="header-section-number">Chapter 1</span> Frederick and Marie Reuschell</h1>
<p>Fredrick Reuschell was born on June 29, 1855 in the state of Shleswig-Holstein in Germany. This is the northernmost German state and abuts Denmark on the north. In fact, this state was variously under Danish or German control and was part of Denmark when Frederick was born. It became part of Prussia in 1867 and so was effectively under German control when Frederick finally left Germany in 1887. Marie Clausen was also born in 1855 in Schleswig-Holstein. She and Fred married in Germany and had a child, August, on March 9, 1879.</p>
<p>Fred, Marie, and August immigrated to Chicago in 1887. The first written record we have of them in the United States is in the Chicago City Directory of 1892 which lists Fred as a baker at 286 W. Huron in Chicago. This was at the corner of Huron and Ashland Ave. (Addresses in Chicago before 1910 were assigned differently than they are now. The current location for this is 1536 W. Huron.) In their first 7 years in Chicago, they would have four more children: Annie (August 7, 1887), Emma (January, 1889), Frederick (October 25, 1892), and Minnie (October 2, 1894). Fred was naturalized on October 15, 1894.</p>

<p>By 1900, the Reuschells lived at 2634 Thomas. The 1900 census lists Fred, Marie, the five children, and Anna Clausen, Marie’s mother as living in that place. Daughter Annie was listed as a bakery clerk, no doubt working in her father’s bakery. There is no occupation listed for August though he was 21 at the time. No doubt he also was working in the bakery.</p>

<p>By 1910, the Reuschells had moved to 6513 Irving Park Rd. and Fred was to have a bakery there for the rest of his life. The bakery was right across the street from the Cook County Insane Asylum, commonly known as Dunning, and the neighborhood is also called Dunning. By 1910, just Emma, Fred, and Minnie were at home.</p>

<p>In 1920, the Reuschells had moved next door (presumably) to 6511 Irving Park Rd. and now it was just Fred, Marie, and their granddaughter Evelyn Brotzman (Emma’s daughter) who was born in 1911.</p>

<p>Fred died in 1935 and Marie in 1946. They were known as Mudda and Fudda to their descendants. After Fred died, Marie would move in with her daughter, Minnie, who had married Harold Trostrud. Harold was a Norwegian immigrant, a World War I veteran, and a stock trader by profession. Minnie and Harold did not have any children.</p>
