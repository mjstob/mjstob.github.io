<h1><span class="header-section-number">Chapter 1</span> Introduction</h1>
<p>Calvin University opened in 1876 as a theological school to train ministers for the Christian Reformed Church. Students completed four years of preparatory studies and two years of theological studies. The preparatory studies were essentially equivalent to a high-school education and ceased to offered in 1924 when Grand Rapids Christian High School opened. In 1894, the institution began admitting other students to the preparatory school and eventually offered the preparatory program in four tracks: Seminary Preparatory, Classical, Modern Classical, and Teachers’ Preparatory. By 1906, the college offered two years of general work beyond the four-year preparatory program and became known as “Calvin Junior College.”</p>
<p>The 1920-21 academic year opened with the institution newly named Calvin College. A full four-year program (beyond the preparatory school) was offered and its completion resulted in the A.B. degree. To receive this degree, students completed 120 hours including 54 hours of what we now call general education and 66 hours of courses chosen from three different groups. (The groups were, roughly, Languages and Literature, Science and Mathematics, and Social Sciences and Philosophy.) Students were required to choose a major group and a minor group and complete at least 24 hours in the major group and 20 in the minor group. This very broad program was loosely patterned on that of the Free University of Amsterdam. The catalog laid out specific courses for students who were pre-seminary, pre-medical, pre-engineering, and pre-law. The college opened its doors with William Rinck as its first and only mathematics professor. Rinck also served as the college’s registrar in that first year. Rinck was not new to the college having spent the previous 15 years teaching in the preparatory school and the junior college.</p>
<p>In the next several chapters, I tell my version of the story of the first hundred years (1920-2020) of the mathematics department. Of course there are many different ways to tell that story. Certainly a lot depends on the documentation at hand. I am relying principally on two sources. The first is college catalogs. All 100 of the college catalogs are available on-line through Calvin’s Office of Student Success. The catalogs are indispensable for documenting the faculty and curriculum. The second source is my own recollection (enhanced by my personal files). I have been associated with the mathematics department for exactly half of those 100 years having arrived as freshman in 1970 to take an Honors Calculus class taught by Larry Nyhoff. Additionally, I was privileged to be a colleague of Carl Sinke and Paul Zwier whose association with the department went back 20 years before mine and who were perfectly capable of regaling us younger faculty with stories of what it was like in the (good?) old days.</p>
<p>I have chosen to divide the 100 years into four eras. These span the periods 1920-1955, 1955-1980, 1980-2000, and 2000-2020. Of course divisions such as these are artificial just as the sorting of people into generations (Boomers, X, Y, etc.) is. Change in an academic department is not exactly a continuous function. Each academic year serves as a sort of a jump discontinuity with new students, new faculty, and perhaps curricular change. But the year to year changes are gradual so that it is impossible to detect specific years that marked major shifts. So others looking the department and the college might see my divisions as oversimplifications or flat out wrong. Some might want to change the boundaries (the boundaries that I have chosen are definitely artificial) or add eras. But it seems to me that looking at the department through the lens of the four themes that I propose adds to understanding beyond what simply a year to year recounting of people and events might do.</p>
<p>The next four chapters cover the four eras that I have defined above. But,
in thinking about this broad history of the department, I identified several issues and themes that deserved separate treatment. These are covered in later chapters.</p>
